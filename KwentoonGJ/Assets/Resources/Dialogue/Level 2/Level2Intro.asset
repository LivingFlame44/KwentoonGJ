      line: (Golden afternoon light spills across the classroom desks as Cali approaches
        Angelo, who's hunched over her notes. The papers are visibly worn - corners
        folded, edges frayed from constant handling, and covered in messy annotations
        in three different colors of ink.)

        shakes it off as their study session begins in earnest.)
